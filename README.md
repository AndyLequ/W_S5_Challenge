# Sprint 5 Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to Sprint Challenge 5! Today, you'll practice using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM by fetching data from the network and building a section of a web page using "vanilla" JavaScript, without any frameworks.

This experience will give you a taste of what your first task at a software company might feel like, and it matches the difficulty and scope of a take-home assignment during a hiring process for a Web Developer position.

Here's an overview of the tasks you need to complete:

1. **Obtain** JSON data from a web service.
1. **Combine** data obtained from different sources into a single data structure.
1. **Render** repeatable components to the DOM using the combined data.

To succeed in this challenge, you'll need the following technical skills:

1. **Promises** and the ability to deal with asynchronous code.
1. **Making HTTP requests** with Axios or fetch.
1. **Looping over data** to populate a new data structure.
1. **Selecting elements** and groups of elements from the DOM.
1. **Creating new elements** and attaching them to the DOM.
1. **Altering the text content** and class names of elements based on certain events.
1. **Adding simple interactivity** to elements via event listeners.

Additionally, the following soft skills will greatly impact your performance:

1. Attention to detail. Make sure there isn't a single character out of place!
1. Perseverance. Keep trying until you figure it out!
1. Patience. Make sure to read the entire README for important information.

## Context

On your first day as a junior web developer at a coding school, you have been assigned a ticket to complete. The task involves adding a new feature to the school's software platform.

Specifically, you need to complete a page that displays a list of learners along with their basic information such as ID, name, email, and a list of mentors. Users should be able to click on a learner to highlight it, and the list of mentors for each learner should be expandable and collapsible. You can refer to the [full mockup](https://w-s5-challenge.herokuapp.com/) for the design and behavior of the page.

To help you complete the task, several members of your team will provide you with instructions and advice.

This is a **full-stack web application** that comprises both back-end and front-end components. When deployed to production, the back-end part would run in the cloud (think Amazon Web Services or Azure), while the front-end would execute inside the user's web browser (like Chrome for Android, or Firefox for desktop).

As a front-end engineer, your focus is mainly on the files that load **on the user's device**. In this particular project, these files live inside the `frontent` folder (but there are many ways to organize a project). The `backend` folder contains a web server built in Node, but the project as a whole is managed as a Node app, with a `package.json` file at the root containing meta-information and some useful commands developers can use to launch and test the application.

1. You will **clone this repository** to your computer, which will allow you to run the software locally for development and testing purposes.

1. You will navigate your terminal to the project folder **and execute `npm install`**. This will install the libraries listed inside `package.json`. Some of these packages are needed for the back-end to do its job of serving JSON data and front-end assets. Other libs help with things like testing and linting your code.

1. After successful installation you will run, in separate terminals, the two scripts found inside `package.json`. **Execute `npm start` in your first terminal, and `npm test` in your second**. On successful start, you will load the app in Chrome by **navigating the browser to `http://localhost:3001`**. The term "localhost" means "your machine", and the number is called a port, allowing multiple web servers to run on the same computer, with one server per port.

My job assisting you with local setup of the app is done! You will speak to our designer next.

Collaboration between a designer and a web developer can be very powerful. Designers excel at creating amazing user experiences and have a keen eye for beauty and usability, while developers are experts in the underlying technology of the product.

However, it's important to remember that **if a design for a feature exists, it's not a suggestion**. Your job as a web developer is to implement the design with as much fidelity as possible. While a developer might think they have a better way to arrange elements on the screen, the mocks and designs are the result of research and hard work. It's important to treat them with the respect they deserve.

It's crucial to use the readable texts designed for the user interface **verbatim**. If a design reads "Loading Doughnuts...", then "Loading _Your_ Doughnuts..." is incorrect. Attention to detail is critical!

There are other constraints and requirements that must be followed, such as sticking to certain class names or keeping the structure of the HTML a certain way **to avoid breaking the CSS**.

Fortunately, you have [a very detailed mock](https://w-s5-challenge.herokuapp.com/) that you can load in your browser and inspect in detail, which will make your job much easier. And don't worry, **you don't have to write any CSS** because it's already been taken care of!

Hey! Let's make sure you're up to speed with your **action items so far**.

- [x] The app is installed on your machine, with both `start` and `test` scripts running in terminals.
- [x] You studied the [mock](https://w-s5-challenge.herokuapp.com/) in the Elements tab of Dev Tools.
- [x] You saw how some text contents and some class names change as the user clicks around.

Awesome! Our back-end engineer says that the JSON data needed to build the Learner Cards comes from two endpoints:

- Endpoint A [GET] <http://localhost:3001/api/learners>
- Endpoint B [GET] <http://localhost:3001/api/mentors>

‚ùó You should stop now, and **try out both endpoints using Postman**, to see what they return.

Here's the tricky thing: each learner has a short list of mentors, but the response from Endpoint A only identifies the mentors by their ID numbers. This means **you need to match the mentor IDs from Endpoint A with the real names of the mentors, found in the response from Endpoint B**.

You can optionally use `Promise.all` to handle the requests. We do not need the data from request A in order to _start_ request B, so the requests can happen concurrently instead of back-to-back. **This will make the app feel faster** to the user!

Once you have the payloads from Endpoints A and B stored inside variables, check that they match what you saw in Postman, and then **use your JavaScript skills to combine the two lists into a single data structure** that is comfortable to work with. Ideally, it would look something like this:

```js
[
  // etc
  {
    id: 22,
    email:"mickey.mouse@example.com",
    fullName: "Mickey Mouse",
    mentors: ['James Gosling', 'Mary Shaw'] // ‚ùó actual names instead of IDs!
  },
  // etc
]
```

Once you have the data in the right shape, you can **create a component function** that takes a learner in the format above, and returns a Learner Card. Then just loop over the data, generating cards as you go, and attaching them to the DOM.

Make sure that each element you create uses the **exact same class names and text contents** as those in the mock! Also, render the learners **in the same order** as they arrive from Endpoint A.

As for interactivity, all the behaviors on the page as the user clicks on the cards boil down to **changes in text contents of some elements, and changes to some class names** which can be observed in the [mock](https://w-s5-challenge.herokuapp.com/). Do not use any other mechanisms!

It might seem like you need several click handlers on different elements inside the card, but that would just make the code more complicated. Remember, events bubble up from the target to its ancestor elements! It's easier to just attach an event listener on the card element, and then **check who the target of the click is before taking the appropriate action**.

‚ùó Install the [Eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for VSCode. It will highlight syntax errors and problems right inside your editor.

‚ùó Only make changes to the `frontend/index.js` file.

Reach out if you get too stuck, and have fun!

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How do I submit this task?</summary>

You submit via Codegrade. Check the assignment page on your learning platform.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to install libraries or add scripts to the HTML?</summary>

No. Everything you need should be installed already, including Axios.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I edit the CSS file?</summary>

The CSS is the domain of a different team, and in this particular project we're not supposed to touch it. Do not use inline styles to get around this! It will only make the CSS team angry. And believe me, you want them happy, as they can write CSS twenty times faster than you.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I edit the HTML file?</summary>

This particular part of the product is a Single Page Application, so the HTML is mostly generated by JavaScript. We don't want to manually edit HTML files when the data that powers the site changes often! It would be untenable.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is my code inside index.js wrapped in an async function called sprintChallenge5?</summary>

This way we can easily import your code as a single function in the `mvp.test.js` test suite. The export syntax is at the bottom of `index.js`, but this syntax does not work in the browser, only in the environment where the tests execute, which is Node. The function declaration is prefixed by the `async` keyword to allow you to use `await` inside it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I debug this project?</summary>

Save your changes, and reload the site in Chrome. If you have a syntax error in your code, the app will crash and you will see errors in the Console. Put console logs before the crash site (error messages usually inform of the line where the crash is happening) and see if your variables contain the data you think they do.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I run tests against my code?</summary>

Execute `npm test` in your terminal. These are the same tests that execute inside Codegrade. Although this never crossed your mind, tampering with the test file won't change your score, because Codegrade uses a pristine copy of the original test file, `mvp.test.js`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I believe my code is correct and the test is wrong. What do I do?</summary>

Sometimes a test refuses to budge, even if (we think) our code is doing the right thing. Use CTRL-C to kill the tests, and then `npm test` to launch them again, just in case there is a problem with the test runner. More likely, there is a problem with your code. Try your best to reproduce the error by interacting with the site in Chrome. Do not code "to make the test happy". Code so that the browser does exactly what the mock does. The tests are there for confirmation. If the problem persists, please request assistance from Staff.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>The output of the test script is too overwhelming! What do I do?</summary>

If a test complains about something, you should try your best to replicate the problem in Chrome. If you need to disable all tests except the one you are focusing on, edit the `mvp.test.js` file and, as an example, change `test('üëâ it works', () => { etc })` into `test.only('üëâ it works', () => { etc })`. (Note the "only".) This won't affect Codegrade, because Codegrade runs its own version of the tests.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I messed up and want to start over! How do I do that?</summary>

**Do NOT delete your repository from GitHub!** Instead, commit _frequently_ as you work. Make a commit whenever you achieve _anything_ and the app isn't crashing in Chrome. This in practice creates restore points you can use should you wreak havoc with your app. If you find yourself in a mess, use `git reset --hard` to simply discard all changes to your code since your last commit. If you are dead-set on restarting the challenge from scratch, you can do this with Git as well, but it is advised that you request assistance from Staff.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are there so many files in this project?</summary>

Although a small, "old-fashioned" website might be made of just HTML, CSS and JS files, these days we mostly manage projects with Node and its package manager, NPM. Node apps typically have a `package.json` file and several other configuration files placed at the root of the project. This project also includes automated tests and a web server, which adds a little bit of extra complexity and files.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is this how web projects are normally organized?</summary>

Web projects can be organized in a million ways, there are no standards beyond the placement of configuration files, which typically live at the root. Some developers like it like this, while others prefer to use opinionated frameworks, which do a lot of magic but prescribe that folders and files be structured and named just so.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the package.json and package-lock.json files?</summary>

The `package.json` file contains meta-information about the project like its version number, scripts that the developer can execute, and a list of the dependencies that are downloaded when you execute `npm install`. There can be some wiggle room to allow newer versions of the dependencies to be installed, so the `package-lock.json` file makes sure the exact same versions of everything are used every time the project is installed from scratch.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the .eslintrc.js file?</summary>

This file works in combination with the Eslint extension for VSCode to highlight syntax errors and problems in your code. By editing this file you can customize your linting rules.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is Jest?</summary>

Jest is a framework that allows you to write tests and execute them, to alert you very quickly of problems with the code. Jest can do in seconds what an entire Quality Assurance team would take hours or even days. In the context of the Sprint Challenge, Jest is used to check your code against specification and give you a grade (% of tests passing).
